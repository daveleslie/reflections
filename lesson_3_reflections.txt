When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    1. When you have more than 1 person working on the codebase.
    2. When you want to access the repo remotely from more than 1 computer
    3. When you want to make the code available to the public for comments/
    or testing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may be working on a feature that is incomplete, while someone else
    commits their changes to the remote. If these changes are then automatically
    merged with your local repo, it could potentially overwrite some of the code
    you are working on, or otherwise cause unforeseen bugs to occur.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - A fork is when you copy another user's repository on github
    - a clone is when you make a copy of a repository on your local computer
      or when you copy a repository from github to your local computer.
    - A branch is a single log of commits made to a repository. Multiple
      branches can be made to test out different features in an application
      without causing the main code base to beome unstable.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    - If you are going offline you can continue working on your own local
      branch and then merge with the latest remote repo when done without
      needing access to the internet.
